This CFC allows you to call KENDO_Get_Grid() to generate and include a javascript-based grid using Kendo UI (http://www.kendoui.com/). 
Note, this is only for the Web widgets and currently uses the minified open source version of Kendo.

This application expects a directory called "kendoui" with the minified js and style files from the website previously mentioned.
